### Description ###

Completely rewrite the vanilla calculation for line of sight as well as what is considered cover.
In general it's now easier to look around cover and uphill and you can actually hide behind hills now from enemy archers or at least use them as cover.
These two rewrites can be turned off in the options.

### Future Plans: ###

- Maybe pre-generated visibility from every tile to every tile at the start of a battle? Unfortunately this action is highly expensive and not realistic
